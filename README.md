# screencast4j

Simple Java frontend for creating screencasts by recording the following:

* sound (WAV)
* desktop (H.264)
* webcam (H.264)

Each of the sources, sound, webcam and screen, get stored in separate files.
These files you can then combine using a 
[video editing software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_editing_software) 
like [OpenShot](http://openshot.org/), [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/),
[Shotcut](http://www.shotcut.org/) or [Pitivi](http://pitivi.org/).
